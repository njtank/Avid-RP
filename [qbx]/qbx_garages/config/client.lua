    Job Vehicles Configuration
    Every job-specific garage is identified by a unique jobGarageIdentifier.
    
    For each garage:
    - `label` provides a descriptive name for the garage.
    - `vehicles` is a grade-based list of vehicles available for that grade.
    For each vehicle:
    - `model` is the internal name of the vehicle.
    - `label` is the display name for the vehicle.
    - `configName` (optional) is a unique configuration identifier.
    - `job` (optional) restricts the vehicle to a specific job if multiple have access to this garage. If omitted, it's available for all jobs that have access to this sepecific garage.
    - with multi job restriction:  {"police", "swat"} --> If, for instance, 'ambulance' had access to this garage too, they wouldn't see this vehicle, only police and swat (in this example). 
    ---- NOTE: If you want the same vehicle with different liveries, create two entries with distinct configurations.    

    -- set useVehicleSpawner = true for each garage that has type job and should use the vehicle spawner instead of personal vehicles
