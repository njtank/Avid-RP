Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, but NOT SELL 
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. You must not blame the author for any bugs, crashes, data loss, or accidental summoning of demons caused by using the Software.

2. Selling this code, in whole or in part, will result in the following punishment:
   - You will be required to write “I will not sell someone else’s code” 100 times on a whiteboard while wearing a chicken costume.
   - You will also owe the all contributors a large pizza, with extra cheese (pineapple optional but encouraged).
   - Additionally, you must serenade all contributors with your rendition of "Baby Shark" while doing the hokey pokey.
   - **WARNING**: Selling or try to sell this code may result in the sudden and unexplained loss of two balls. Could be soccer balls, could be bowling balls... who knows? It's a mystery! But they will disappear or not work properly.

3. Everyone can modify this code. If you make improvements, consider submitting a pull request. The author will be eternally grateful and may even name a pizza after you (extra cheese included)!

4. If you attempt to sell the code and end up in a personal disaster (like stepping on a LEGO or getting your favorite snack stolen by a squirrel), the author will not be liable. However, you are welcome to share your misadventures in a public forum—bonus points for dramatic reenactments!

5. Have fun, but remember: if things go wrong, you can’t say I didn’t warn you. Also, if your computer starts talking back, consider an exorcism.
