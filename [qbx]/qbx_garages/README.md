### New Phone Tracking Using Export
Replace:

```
RegisterNUICallback('track-vehicle', function(data, cb)
    local veh = data.veh
    if findVehFromPlateAndLocate(veh.plate) then
        QBCore.Functions.Notify("Your vehicle has been marked", "success")
    else
        QBCore.Functions.Notify("This vehicle cannot be located", "error")
    end
    cb("ok")
end)
```

With:

```
RegisterNUICallback('track-vehicle', function(data, cb)
    local veh = data.veh
    if veh.state == 'In' then
        exports['qb-garages']:TrackVehicleByPlate(veh.plate)
        TriggerEvent('qb-phone:client:CustomNotification',
            "GARAGE",
            "GPS Marker Set!",
            "fas fa-car",
            "#e84118",
            5000
        )
