## Features:
- Allow the player to hunt animals naturally spawning.
- Carcass are physically drag/carry.
- Carcass quality is defined by the type weapon used and if the animal has been headshot
- Anti-farm (force player to not stay on the same animal spawn point)
- Carcass degradation (sell price will decrease overtime)
