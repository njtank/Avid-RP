# Randolio: Cargo Deliveries

**ESX/QB/ND support with bridge**

Inspired from the GTA Online cargo deliveries which use the flatbed and the duneloader. Random vehicle type, route and payout all configurable from sv_routes.lua.
GTA scaleforms and drop off draw marker for nostalgic reasons. Utilizing ox lib throughout.

There is an event handler called 'randol_cargo:handleVehicleKeys' for each framework in the bridge. You'll have to fill that in to fit your keys system.
